Predictive Modelling for Drug Repurposing Using Molecular Fingerprints and Machine Learning
Using three common fingerprint encodings – MACCS (166 bits), PubChem (881 bits) and extended-connectivity (ECFP, 1024 bits) – combined with RF workflows, we observed performance across four endpoints: blood-brain (BBB) permeability, clinical-trial toxicity (ClinTox), antibacterial activity and neuroprotection. The core focus of the study, investigate the application of simple RF workflows to identify novel neuroprotective candidates using a natural-compound library.
